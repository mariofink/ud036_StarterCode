# Some of my favourite movies website

This is part of Udacityâ€™s Full Stack Web Developer course I am currently attending.

The code in this program is generating a web page that 
displays some of my favourite movies. For each movie you can
see the title, poster and trailer.

## Usage
To generate and open the webpage you need to run fresh_tomatoes.py

    python fresh_tomatoes.py
